# Declarify JS

* A clientside library for declarative UI development.
* Develop dynamic user interfaces for modern web applications in pure
HTML&mdash;no JavaScript coding required.
* Create and organize frontend code efficiently, without requiring a
secondary effort to develop a JavaScript architecture.
* Supports dynamic behaviors, custom HTML widgets, AJAX communication
with the server, etc.

## Demo

A couple of (rough) demos [here](http://micha.github.com/declarify.js/test.html)
and [here](http://micha.github.com/declarify.js/index.html).

## Use It

To use declarify you can download the `_site/declarify.js` file and include
that in the HTML document head. 

## Motivation

Web user interface development is a complex process. Designing a good-looking,
dynamic, extensible, and maintainable UI framework is hard to do. Normally,
this development process would involve organizing HTML markup, CSS/Sass, and
associated JavaScript modules, plus a slew of naming conventions applied to
HTML element ids and classes (used to link JavaScript modules to DOM elements).

## Contribute

Jekyll is used to build the final js file, just because I'm using that for
other things in the project I'm working on anyway. The source files are in
the `_includes` directory. Fork and send pull request, by all means.
