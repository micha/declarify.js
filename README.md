# Declarify JS

A clientside library for declarative UI development. No JS coding involved.

## Use It

To use declarify you can download the `_site/declarify.js` file and include
that in the HTML document head. 

## Contribute

Jekyll is used to build the final js file, just because I'm using that for
other things in the project I'm working on anyway. The source files are in
the `_includes` directory. Fork and send pull request, by all means.
